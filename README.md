# Project:- Covid-19 Predictions using Machine Learning

Covid-19 first wave was on peak in March 2020 to October 2020 and there is a need of a model which can predict the Covid-19 cases. This was the main idea and motive behind this project.

We have built a ML model for the data visualisation and prediction of Covid cases. We have applied different algorithms such as Linear Regression, KNN Regressor, Decision Tree, Random forest etc and calculate their Mean squared error to find out that which algorithm is best fit.

### Mean squared errors of differet algorithms
         1. Linear Regression       --  0.1995
         2. KNN Regressor           --  0.24
         3. Decision Tree Regressor --  0.2222
         4. Random Forest Regressor --  0.1111
         
Algorithm having least mean squared error is best algorithm and hence Random forest is best fit.

Also we have seen the Impact of Covid-19 on Education System by Data Visualization and found that:-

         1. Laptops/Desktops were the most used devices for online learning.
         2. Music was the favourite stress buster.
         3. Most of the students miss school and colleges.
         4. Most of the students didn't like online classes.
